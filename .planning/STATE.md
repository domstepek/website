# Project State

## Project Reference

See: `.planning/PROJECT.md` (updated 2026-03-09)

**Core value:** Someone should be able to land on the site and quickly understand what kinds of complex systems Dom builds, then explore the domains that matter to them without getting buried in noise.
**Current focus:** Phase 6 — Set up custom domain via is-a-dev/register

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in `PROJECT.md` Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Init]: Use a minimal landing page with deeper linked pages
- [Init]: Organize the site by domains/themes rather than a flat project gallery
- [Init]: Use a casual lowercase voice
- [Research]: Build as a static Astro site for GitHub Pages
- [Phase 01]: Default to the current GitHub Pages project-site shape while keeping site origin and base path overridable through PUBLIC_SITE_URL and PUBLIC_BASE_PATH. — This keeps the repository deploy-path-safe today while allowing a repo rename or custom domain later without rewriting routes.
- [Phase 01]: Create shared site metadata and URL helpers before layouts so later plans inherit one source of truth for canonical URLs, assets, and internal routes. — Centralizing the URL logic early removes the highest-risk Pages regression before page templates multiply.
- [Phase 01]: Keep the homepage intentionally minimal and use it as a smoke consumer of the new path helpers instead of pulling later-phase content forward. — This keeps plan 01 focused on infrastructure and avoids blurring the boundary with the homepage/content plans.
- [Phase 01]: Let BaseLayout own the shared metadata API and landmark structure so future pages only need page-level overrides. — This keeps head tags, canonicals, and semantic landmarks consistent as more routes are added.
- [Phase 01]: Ship the shell with readable typography, skip-link support, and visible focus styles before content-heavy phases. — This avoids treating accessibility and reading quality as cleanup work later.
- [Phase 01]: Route favicon and default OG assets through siteConfig plus shared path helpers. — This keeps metadata asset URLs valid under the GitHub Pages base path and avoids page-by-page drift.
- [Phase 01]: Validate the built `dist` artifacts rather than source templates so the release gate matches what GitHub Pages will actually publish. — This catches missing copied assets and emitted metadata regressions before deploy.
- [Phase 01]: Derive default Pages `PUBLIC_SITE_URL` and `PUBLIC_BASE_PATH` from repository context in CI, while still allowing repository-variable overrides. — This keeps project-site deploys working by default without hard-coding the final hosted URL.
- [Phase 01]: Treat live GitHub Pages publish and manual QA as an explicit user-setup handoff when the remote/Pages target is not trustworthy in the local repo state. — This preserves an honest phase gate without pretending hosted verification already happened.
- [Phase 01]: Prefer `/agent-browser --native` for browser-accessible site smoke checks before escalating to human-only validation. — This lets future verification cover live URLs, asset paths, source inspection, and 404 behavior directly in-browser while reserving people for subjective layout and keyboard-usage judgment.
- [Phase 02 Context]: Use short domain titles, give each project one canonical home domain, and assign that home by the primary problem solved while allowing light cross-links for overlap.
- [Phase 02 Context]: Open each domain page with a first-person thesis sentence, short bullets, and an explicit scope line inside one shared page pattern.
- [Phase 02 Context]: Present supporting work as moderately curated stacked entries with inline proof links and an explicit top-of-page `back home` link.
- [Phase 02]: Keep the five domain hubs in one typed registry with one module per domain so future homepage and validation work use the same source of truth.
- [Phase 02]: Render every domain through one shared text-first template with inline proof links and stable `data-*` markers so later validation can inspect built HTML instead of source.
- [Phase 02]: Use related-domain links for overlap instead of duplicating full supporting-work entries across multiple domain pages.
- [Phase 02]: Make each scope line explicitly contrast neighboring domains so visitors can tell the hubs apart from the opening section alone.
- [Phase 02]: Keep supporting-work proof links inline but on their own short line so visitors scan the work before deciding to click out.
- [Phase 02]: Handle cross-domain overlap with brief linked notes inside supporting items instead of duplicating full entries.
- [Phase 02]: Validate the five domain hubs from emitted `dist` HTML instead of source templates so the release gate matches what GitHub Pages will actually publish.
- [Phase 02]: Derive the expected back-home href from each domain page's canonical URL so structural validation stays base-path aware without depending on source helpers.
- [Phase 02]: Run Phase 1 and Phase 2 validators through one `validate:site` command and reuse it in CI so future phases extend a single site-level gate.
- [Phase 03]: Keep homepage-specific copy, contact links, freshness, and SEO fields in `src/data/home.ts` so the landing route stays thin and later copy work has one source of truth.
- [Phase 03]: Render homepage navigation from the shared `domains` registry and `domainPath(slug)` helpers instead of inventing a second homepage-only link list. — This preserves the domain-first architecture and keeps internal links GitHub Pages-safe.
- [Phase 03]: Keep `src/pages/index.astro` as a thin route that passes metadata into `BaseLayout` and renders `HomePage`. — This preserves the shared layout contract from Phase 1 and keeps page-shell logic centralized.
- [Phase 03]: Keep the hero explicit about analytics, infrastructure, ai / ml, product, and developer experience so the first screen explains scope without extra narrative. — This keeps the homepage acting as an orientation layer instead of a vague personal statement.
- [Phase 03]: Reuse the shared domain `summary` lines as homepage navigation copy instead of creating homepage-only blurbs. — This keeps the homepage and domain pages aligned as the content evolves.
- [Phase 03]: Keep homepage layout styling in `src/styles/global.css`, with the domain list as the main navigation block and contact plus freshness as a lighter secondary cluster. — This preserves the minimal text-first baseline without inventing a second visual system.
- [Phase 03]: Validate the homepage from built dist/index.html so the gate matches the artifact GitHub Pages will publish. — Keeps the homepage release check aligned with the emitted HTML instead of the source templates and catches deploy-time regressions before Pages publishes them.
- [Phase 03]: Derive expected homepage domain hrefs from the emitted canonical URL so the validator stays base-path aware without importing source helpers. — Lets the validator follow the published base path automatically while remaining independent from application runtime code.
- [Phase 03]: Extend the existing validate:site chain instead of creating a separate homepage CI path. — Preserves one release gate for the site and makes homepage regressions fail the same workflow already guarding Phases 1 and 2.
- [Phase 04]: Keep flagship proof inline on the existing shared domain page pattern instead of introducing standalone case-study routes. — This deepens the domain hubs without undoing the Phase 2 information architecture.
- [Phase 04]: Promote flagship stories from the existing supporting-work shortlist and keep visuals limited to local explainers where they materially help. — This keeps the site text-forward while making the proof layer more concrete.
- [Phase 04]: Extend `validate:site` with a dist-first Phase 4 validator that checks built domain artifacts, story structure, and optional visual output. — This keeps flagship regressions inside the same release gate as the earlier phases.
- [Phase 05]: Keep the main personal layer on a dedicated `/about/` page, with the homepage only adding a light teaser plus a direct resume anchor entry point. — This preserves the domain-first homepage while still making the personal layer easy to find.
- [Phase 05]: Treat the about page's `resume` section as the canonical v1 resume surface instead of depending on a separate PDF. — This keeps resume access repo-owned, one-click reachable, and compatible with the site's text-forward style.
- [Phase 05]: Build notes with Astro content collections and plain Markdown, then render them through a simple reverse-chronological index and thin note-detail routes. — This adds repeatable note content without turning v1 into a blog platform.
- [Phase 05]: Extend `validate:site` with a dist-first Phase 5 validator that follows rendered note links and checks the homepage teaser, about page, notes index, and note detail pages from built output. — This keeps Phase 5 regressions inside the same site-level release gate as the earlier phases.
- [Phase 06]: Changed DEFAULT_SITE_URL and DEFAULT_BASE_PATH in both astro.config.mjs and src/data/site.ts to point to jean-dominique-stepek.is-a.dev with root base path. — This is the core config transition that makes all canonical URLs, OG tags, and internal routes use the new custom domain.
- [Phase 06]: Updated site description to visitor-facing casual lowercase voice matching existing site tone. — The old description was repo-style; the new one describes what Dom builds.
- [Phase 06]: Replaced CI dynamic format() fallbacks with static custom domain strings while preserving vars.* override mechanism. — This ensures CI builds default to the custom domain without losing the ability to override via repository variables.
- [Phase 06]: Recorded Task 2 as manually completed with corrected GitHub username (domstepek, not jstepek) and CNAME target (domstepek.github.io). — Plan originally had wrong username; user completed domain registration manually with correct values.

### Roadmap Evolution

- Phase 6 added: Set up custom domain via is-a-dev/register
- Phase 6 captures the custom domain registration and site configuration work needed after the main v1 content/site build is in place.
