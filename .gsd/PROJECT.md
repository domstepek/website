# Project

## What This Is

A personal website for Dom that gives recruiters, collaborators, and curious peers a fast read on the systems, products, infrastructure, and tooling he has built. The site is intentionally domain-first rather than a flat repo gallery, with a minimal homepage and deeper proof on portfolio pages. Protected domain pages are gated behind a passcode with a visual blur/reveal unlock flow.

## Core Value

Someone should be able to land on the site, quickly understand what kinds of complex systems Dom builds, and access the right level of proof for their context.

## Current State

M001 is shipped. The site runs as a static Astro site on GitHub Pages with a custom domain, a public homepage, public about and resume pages, a lightweight notes area, and five domain-based portfolio pages with flagship proof and supporting work.

M002 is complete. All four slices (S01–S04) are shipped: `/`, `/about/`, and `/resume/` remain explicitly public, while `/domains/*` routes render a locked retro gate shell on cold load with request-access messaging (canonical email and LinkedIn links), a passcode form with SHA-256 hash validation, session-scoped unlock that carries across protected routes via a sessionStorage + localStorage bridge, and a CSS-driven blur-to-clear visual reveal with screenshot gallery rendering after unlock. The full milestone is proven by 20 browser tests, 3 dist validators, and the `pnpm validate:site` release gate chaining S01→S02→S03→S04. All 12 tracked requirements are validated; zero remain active.

M003 is complete. Custom WebGPU/WebGL2 faded dither shader renders as ambient cursor-reactive background across all pages with per-page opt-out, reduced-motion freeze, tab-visibility pause, and 23-test regression coverage.

## Architecture / Key Patterns

- Astro + TypeScript + plain CSS on GitHub Pages
- Domain-first information architecture with route helpers in `src/lib/paths.ts`
- Thin route files with shared data modules and shared presentational components
- Dist-first validation scripts that verify shipped output before deploy
- Public site surfaces remain lightweight, text-forward, and base-path aware
- Client-side passcode gate with SHA-256 hash validation and session-scoped unlock
- CSS-driven blur-to-clear visual reveal with stable DOM marker contracts
- 20 browser tests + 3 dist validators in `pnpm validate:site` release gate

## Capability Contract

See `.gsd/REQUIREMENTS.md` for the explicit capability contract, requirement status, and coverage mapping.

## Milestone Sequence

- [x] M001: Public portfolio foundation — Ship the domain-first personal site with homepage, domain hubs, flagship proof, about/resume, notes, and custom domain.
- [x] M002: Portfolio access gate — Lightweight passcode gate protecting domain portfolio proof with session-scoped unlock, visual blur/reveal, request-access messaging, and 20-test regression coverage.
- [x] M003: GPU shader background — Custom faded dither shader (WebGPU + WebGL2 fallback) as ambient cursor-reactive background across all pages with per-page opt-out.
- [ ] M004: Sentence case audit — Convert all visitor-facing copy from all-lowercase to sentence case with standard "I" capitalization, preserving casual tone.
