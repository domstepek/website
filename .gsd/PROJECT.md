# Project

## What This Is

A personal website for Dom that gives recruiters, collaborators, and curious peers a fast read on the systems, products, infrastructure, and tooling he has built. The site is intentionally domain-first rather than a flat repo gallery, with a minimal homepage and deeper proof on portfolio pages.

## Core Value

Someone should be able to land on the site, quickly understand what kinds of complex systems Dom builds, and access the right level of proof for their context.

## Current State

M001 is shipped. The site runs as a static Astro site on GitHub Pages with a custom domain, a public homepage, public about and resume pages, a lightweight notes area, and five domain-based portfolio pages with flagship proof and supporting work.

M002 is planned next. It will add a lightweight portfolio access gate so the public site stays discoverable while the deeper proof layer on domain pages is password-gated behind a simple session passcode flow.

## Architecture / Key Patterns

- Astro + TypeScript + plain CSS on GitHub Pages
- Domain-first information architecture with route helpers in `src/lib/paths.ts`
- Thin route files with shared data modules and shared presentational components
- Dist-first validation scripts that verify shipped output before deploy
- Public site surfaces remain lightweight, text-forward, and base-path aware

## Capability Contract

See `.gsd/REQUIREMENTS.md` for the explicit capability contract, requirement status, and coverage mapping.

## Milestone Sequence

- [x] M001: Public portfolio foundation — Ship the domain-first personal site with homepage, domain hubs, flagship proof, about/resume, notes, and custom domain.
- [ ] M002: Portfolio access gate — Keep public positioning pages open while password-gating the deeper domain portfolio proof behind a simple static session passcode flow.
