  thesis:
    "I build analytics and AI systems when the real bottleneck is understanding the business or making model-backed workflows actually useful — not collecting one more table or adding a chatbot veneer.",
  scope:
    "This covers the reporting, measurement, AI-assisted curation, and data-trust side of products — the work where the main challenge is making the numbers useful and the model behavior practical.",

      summary:
        "A full-stack analytics platform combining an operator-facing portal with real-time collaboration, a configurable curation table, a PowerPoint-style presentation builder, an AI chatbot, and a production API backend with AI layer — replacing scattered tools and ad hoc data pulls.",
      problem:
        "Teams needed one place to inspect product data, curate seasonal collections, build presentations, and get AI-assisted answers without bouncing between separate tools, spreadsheets, and ad hoc queries.",
      role:
        "I shaped the reporting workflow and built key frontend features — the configurable curation table, real-time collaboration via Legend State sync engine, and the PowerPoint-style presentation builder — while also architecting the API backend that brought conventional API work and AI-assisted behavior into one service boundary.",
      constraints: [
        "The portal had to support quick checks, deeper investigation, real-time multi-user collaboration, and presentation building without collapsing into a generic dashboard shell.",
        "The API needed to handle both conventional GraphQL queries and AI-specific behavior (retrieval, generation, agent tools) in the same service boundary.",
        "Node and Python concerns needed to cooperate without exposing the Python surface directly — FastAPI sat behind a reverse-proxied secondary service.",
        "The system needed real auth, validation, and data plumbing because the goal was production use, not a prototype.",
      ],
      decisions: [
        "Centered the portal on operator workflows instead of a chart-first dashboard layout, with filter and drill-down paths tied to follow-up actions.",
        "Built the curation table with configurable column types (multiselects, dates, tags) so analysts could filter and organize product data without falling back to spreadsheets.",
        "Used Legend State for real-time sync and collaboration instead of Redux, enabling multiple users to work on the same view simultaneously.",
        "Paired Express and Apollo for the main API surface while keeping FastAPI behind a reverse proxy for Python-heavy AI work.",
        "Used Prisma, Redis pub/sub, and Cognito-backed middleware so the AI exploration lived inside normal backend discipline.",

      outcomes: [
        "One reporting and curation surface for product data, filters, real-time collaboration, presentations, and AI-assisted answers — instead of stitching context together across tools.",

        "The AI chatbot using AWS Bedrock and RAG retrieval cut support tickets by 50% by answering platform-related user queries directly.",
        "The API architecture proved more capable for AI-assisted curation than the existing AppSync path alone.",
